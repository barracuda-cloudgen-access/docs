# Fyde CLI Client

The Fyde CLI Client, fyde-cli, provides some of the [Fyde Enterprise Console]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link fyde-enterprise-console/README.md %}) functionality as a command-line utility.

Available for Linux, macOS and Windows, fyde-cli is designed with interactive usage and automation in mind.
It can be used to obtain information from the Fyde Enterprise Console, such as access and security events, for processing by another system.

The Fyde CLI Client is an open source project under active development.
For installation instructions and documentation, please visit [fyde-cli on GitHub](https://github.com/fyde/fyde-cli).
